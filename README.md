i mean look my shit is working fine but there can be a few vital optimizations to be done: 

Cache Your Vector Store : yes ofc i have to do this shit to persist the index through run coz i am already having a response time avg 10 sec which is not so nice

Timeouts / Fallbacks: yes ur right i may have to do this but not high priority rn

here is a problem look when the query is some unrelated bs and llm1 tells me that... i should not call the web search and vector search coz thats just waste of bandwidth , ai tokens , db reads and also increasing the response time  ... moreover if i call them they do generate a big response regardless coz everything is on web and also pinecone will thorugh results doesnt mater how unrelated (howvere i can use the threshold match to resolve this) which makes the final ll2 call big (again waste of tokens)...and this problem is quite hard to solve coz i might just have to change the whole flow using lang-graph and maintain a state with flags and shit and make the functions as tools to call

but i see you were mentioning something like: 
 lightweight classifier (like OpenAI Moderation API or a fast zero-shot NLI) before even hitting LLM1.

if i can implement something like that in that case i think this will be lot easier to solve
